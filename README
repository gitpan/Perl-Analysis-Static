NAME
    Perl::Analysis::Static - analyse your Perl documents (without running
    them)

VERSION
    version 0.004

DESCRIPTION
    Perl::Analysis::Static extracts information from your Perl sources. It's
    a toolbox for developers to take a look at their code. It examines the
    code without running it.

    Perl is notoriously hard to parse because of its flexible syntax. Thus,
    programs (and sometimes humans) have a hard time telling where variables
    are declared, subroutines are called and if they are used at all. The
    tools in this distribution hope to give humans and programs the means to
    get answers for questions about perl code.

    Humans may use the perlanalyst on the command line whilst machines ought
    to use the API provided by Perl::Analysis::Static::Question and friends.

    Here are some basic examples to help get you started.

      # find all subroutine declarations, recursively process all Perl
      # files beneath directory
      perlanalyst --all Sub
  
      # the same, but show only the declaration of the subroutine "foo"
      perlanalyst --all Sub --filter Name=foo

      # the same, but asked as a question
      perlanalyst --question Sub::Name=foo
  
      # the same, but look in another directory
      perlanalyst -q Sub::Name=foo ~/perl5/lib/perl5/Test

      # list questions you may ask
      perlanalyst --list-questions
  
      # list analyses
      perlanalyst --list-analyses
  
      # list filters
      perlanalyst --list-filters

      # see a list of the files that would be examined
      perlanalyst --list-files

INSTALLATION
    Please refer to the file INSTALL for documentation of the installation
    process.

WARNING
    This is alpha software. This means that everything may change any time.
    Programs, modules and variables might be renamed, APIs may be created or
    deleted, command line arguments may vanish.

A WORD ABOUT WORDS
    The wonderful PPI, which we use for parsing sources, introduced the
    concept of a Perl document. We'll stick with that terminology.

SEE ALSO
    PPI is used for parsing the Perl documents.

    Perl::Critic is a different kind of tool. It has the knowledge of
    experienced perl programmers built in and tells you if your code smells.
